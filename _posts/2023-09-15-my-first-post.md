During my summer I did a decent amount of things. For example, one thing I did was actually work 2 jobs. In one job I had to create my own project and then present it to people to see if they liked it and sponsor it like if I was in a shark tank episode. 


Then at my next job, I downloaded and tested a bunch of softwares and then I wrote down info that I could get from the software by using the terminal software that is installed on the laptops. It was very boring though
